Description: Returns nonparametric aligned rank tests for the interaction in two-way factorial designs, on R data sets with repeated measures in 'wide' format. Five ANOVAs tables are reported. A PARAMETRIC one on the original data, one for a CHECK upon the interaction alignments, and three aligned rank tests: one on the aligned REGULAR, one on the FRIEDMAN, and one on the KOCH ranks. In these rank tests, only the resulting values for the interaction are relevant.
